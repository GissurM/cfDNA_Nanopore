# cfDNA analysis with Oxford Nanopore Technologies

This repository is intended to store methods, codes and pipeline i use to analyze cfDNA as part of my masters project *final title pending*. 
Any tools and data i use as part of a pipeline that i myself did not create will be mentioned when appropriate and i will post a link to where they can be found.
I will post wrapper scripts I use to run the afforementioned tools with an SBATCH command into this repository which i hope can be of use.
The code of some tools was edited by me to make them run better with newer versions of python packages or to accomadate for unique factors in my digital environment, consider that you may have to make similar edits to make them work for you. 
Going forward each unique pipeline will be covered seperately in their own files that can be found in this repository.
