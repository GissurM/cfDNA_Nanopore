# Repository info 
This repository is a chronicle of coding methods i used to perform multivariant analysis on Oxford Nanopore Technologies data.
I used several tools from other publications and will link them when necessary, I take no credit for the work done to create those tools and will not post any codes or files retrieved from such 
sources. Any such codes will be correctly credited and i will preface if i made any edits to the code and why i made them. 
I will however post any unique wrapper scripts I created mostly to create a convenient means of understanding how such a wrapper script can be made. If any piece of code or data is 
not attributed to anyone specific it can be assumed to be my own work.

Most of the original codes in this repository will be simple python or r scripts or bash wrappers meant to be run via sbatch in a HPC environment and are therefore not individual tools. 
This is mostly meant to be a proof of my own understanding when i turn in my masters project as well as a useful resource for other individuals starting out with performing Nanopore analysis on cfDNA.
Therefore i will be explaining what each code does and how to make it work for a user in more detail than one might usually expect in a github repository, for instance I might occasionally highlight specific problems i faced and how i bypassed them.
Any experienced coders or Nanopore analysts likely will not need to read these details as again the codes i have created are meant to be simple and accessible in nature.

I hope this resource will be of use to any aspiring Oxford Nanopore Technologies data analysts. 

## short legal disclaimer
All original resources posted here are non-licensed and you should therefore feel free to use these codes for any purpose you desire and change them how you like. 
However any 3rd party tools, packages or datasets mentioned and used might have their own licenses and it is the readers own responsibility to get acquinted with any such licenses and to avoid any legal trouble.
Again it is not my intention to claim any credit for work i did not perform and if you notice any conflicts with this statement within this repository please get in contact with me and i will mend it post-haste.
